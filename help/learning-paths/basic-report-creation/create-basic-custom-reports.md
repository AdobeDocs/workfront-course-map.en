# Create basic custom reports

The following four Workfont One Learning Paths,

* Create a basic dashboard
* Create basic custom reports
* Report settings
* Send and share reports

have been combined into a single Experience League course, [Create custom reports and dashboards](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/?recommended=Workfront-U-1-2022.3.reporting){target="_blank"}.

The new Experience League course covers the same learning objectives as the prior learning paths, and has been optimized where possible to provide an optimized learning experience.  Explore the full library of Workfront courses, documentation, tutorials and communities on Experience League.
