# Workfront One to Experience League Learning Map {#overview}

When Workfront One migrated to Experience League, the learning team had an opportunity optimize and improve on both the structure and content contained in the self-guided learning materials originally available to you on Workfront One.  

Here you will find a mapping of the self-guided learning assets previously available on Workfront One to the new self-guided assets on Experience League.  The assets are structured into two categories; Learning Programs and Learning Paths. Use the table of contents on the left to explore the content.
